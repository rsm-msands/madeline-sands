They sent out 50,000 fundraising letters to potential donors, randomly assigning each letter to one of three treatments: a standard letter, a matching grant letter, or a challenge grant letter. They published the results of this experiment in the _American Economic Review_ in 2007. The article and supporting data are available from the [AEA website](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.97.5.1774) and from Innovations for Poverty Action as part of [Harvard's Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/27853&version=4.2).\n\nThe goal of their project was to test the effectiveness of a matching grant on chartiable giving. Via their large-scale natural field experiment, they found that providing a match offer increases both the charitable revenue per solicitation and the response rate to the letters. However, the larger amount of the match ratio, (i.e. $3:$1 and $2:$1), relative to a smaller match ratio, ($1:$1), had no additional impact on the revenue per solicitation nor the response rate to the letter. \n\nThis project seeks to replicate their results.\n\n## Data\n\n::: {#a1a3ad97 .cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport numpy as np \nimport pandas as pd \nfrom scipy.stats import t\nfrom scipy.stats import ttest_ind\n\nkarlan_df = pd.read_stata('data/karlan_list_2007.dta')\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Description\nBelow is a general overview of the data from Karlan et. al 2007. A sample of approximately 50,000 individuals who had given to a charitable organization since 1991 were randomized and assigned into either a \"match\" treatment group or a control group. The treatment group was offered a matching grant conditional on their donation, with the goal to see if the match rate increases the likelihood of a donation in a charitable setting. This dataset contains information such as if the participant was part of the treatment or control, the match ratio, and the size of the donation, in addition to further characteristics about the donor and the donation they made. \n\n::: {#be6642ab .cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nkarlan_df.describe()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display

statistically significant difference between the treatment and control groups at a 95% confidence interval level. The variables `mrm2` and `freq` represent the _Number of Months since last donation_ and _the number of prior dontations_, respectively. Using the t-test-calc function, the calculated t-stat for `mrm2` is **0.1195** and the p-value is **0.9049**. This p-value is greater than the alpha value of 0.005, which means that we fail to reject the null hypothesis, and indicates that there is not enough evidence to conclude a statistically significant difference between the treatment and control groups when examining the number of months since their last donation, or the `mrm2` variable. \n\nFor the `freq` variable, the t_stat and p_value calculated were **-0.1108** and **0.9117**, respectively. The calculated p-value of 0.9117 is greater than the alpha value of 0.05, and we once again fail to reject the null hypothesis. This indicates that there is not enough evidence to indicate a statistically significant difference between the treatment and control groups when comparing the donation frequency. These values are similar to those included in table 1 of Karlan et al. I believe table 1 was included in the paper to show the sample statistics of the member activity, census demographics and the state-level activity of organization. \n\n## Experimental Results\n\n### Charitable Contribution Made\n\nFirst, I analyzed whether matched donations lead to an increased response rate of making a donation. \n\n::: {#6015868e .cell execution_count=5}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport matplotlib as plt\nfrom matplotlib import rcParams\n\nkarlan_df_copy = karlan_df.copy()\nkarlan_grouped = karlan_df.groupby([\"treatment\", \"control\"])[\"gave\"].mean()\nax = karlan_grouped.plot(kind='bar', color = [\"purple\", \"orange\"])\n\nrcParams['font.family'] = 'serif'  # Change 'serif' to the desired font family\nrcParams['font.serif'] = ['Avenir'] \nax.set_xlabel(\"Treatment and Control\")\nax.set_ylabel(\"Proportion of People who Donated\")\n\nax.set_title(\"Proportion of People who Donated in Treatment and Control\")\n\ngroup_labels = ['Treatment', 'Control']\nax.set_xticklabels(group_labels, rotation = 0)\n\nfor i, v in enumerate(karlan_grouped):\n    ax.text(i, v, f'{v:.4f}', ha='center', va='bottom')\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/cell-6-output-1.png){width=606 height=449}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nI also ran a t-test between the treatment and control groups on the binary outcome of whether any charitable donation was made, in addition to running a bivariate linear regression to demonstrate the same finding.\n\n::: {#08823a1e .cell execution_count=6}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nfrom scipy.stats import ttest_ind\nimport scipy.stats as stats\nkarlan_treatment = karlan_df[karlan_df[\"treatment\"] == 1]\nkarlan_control = karlan_df[karlan_df[\"control\"] == 1]\nt_statistic, p_value = stats.ttest_ind(karlan_treatment[\"gave\"], karlan_control[\"gave\"])\n\nprint(\"T-statistic:\", t_statistic)\nprint(\"p-value:\", p_value)\n\n#Bivariate Linear regression on gave\nX = karlan_df[['treatment']]  # Features\ny = karlan_df['gave']  # Target variable\n\nmodel = LinearRegression()\nmodel.fit(X, y)\n\nprint('Coefficients:', model.coef_)\nprint('Intercept:', model.intercept_)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nT-statistic: 3.101361000543946\np-value: 0.0019274025949016988\nCoefficients: [0.00418035]\nIntercept: 0.017858212980165173\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe output indicates a t-statistic of approximately **3.10** and a p-value of approximately **0.002**.\n\nIn interpreting these results, it's important to recall that the t-statistic measures the size of the difference between the treatment and control groups relative to the variability in the data. Thus, the larger the t-statistic, the more the means of the two groups differ. In this case, a t-statistic of 3.10 suggests a substantial difference between the means of the treatment and control groups. \n\nThe p-value, on the other hand, assesses the probability of observing such a large difference if there were no true difference between the treatment and control groups (i.e., if the null hypothesis were true). A small p-value (in this case, 0.002) indicates that the observed difference is unlikely to have occurred by random chance alone. Interpreted in the context of the experiment, these statistical results suggest that there is a statistically significant difference in charitable giving between the treatment and control groups. In other words, the intervention or treatment likely had an effect on the behavior of individuals in the treatment group compared to those in the control group.\n\nTherefore, this finding may imply that the certain interventions or nudges implemented in the treatment group, the matching and challenge grant letters, were effective in encouraging charitable giving behavior. Understanding the effectiveness of these interventions sheds light on the psychological mechanisms and motivations behind charitable giving, potentially informing future strategies for promoting philanthropy and altruism.\n\n\n#### Probit Regression\nNext I ran a probit regression where the outcome variable is whether any charitable donation was made and the explanatory variable was assesment to treatment or control. \n\n::: {#f6cbf9fb .cell execution_count=7}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n#Probit Regression\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\n\nX = karlan_df[['treatment', 'control']]\ny = karlan_df['gave']\n\nmodel = sm.Probit(y, X).fit()\n\nprint(model.summary())\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nOptimization terminated successfully.\n         Current function value: 0.100443\n         Iterations 7\n                          Probit Regression Results                           \n==============================================================================\nDep.

In probit regression, the relationship between the predictor variables and the binary outcome is modeled using the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution (also known as the probit function). The model assumes that the linear combination of predictor variables is associated with the probability of the binary outcome. \n\n### Differences between Match Rates\n\nNext, I assessed the effectiveness of different sizes of matched donations on the response rate.\n\n_todo: Use a series of t-tests to test whether the size of the match ratio has an effect on whether people donate or not. For example, does the 2:1 match rate lead increase the likelihood that someone donates as compared to the 1:1 match rate? Do your results support the \"figures suggest\" comment the authors make on page 8?_\n\n::: {#ebcb247d .cell execution_count=8}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# T-test for ratio2 (2:1 match) compared to 1:1 match\nt_stat_ratio2, p_value_ratio2 = ttest_ind(karlan_df[karlan_df['ratio2'] == 1]['gave'], karlan_df[karlan_df['ratio2'] == 0]['gave'])\n\n# T-test for ratio3 (3:1 match) compared to 1:1 match\nt_stat_ratio3, p_value_ratio3 = ttest_ind(karlan_df[karlan_df['ratio3'] == 1]['gave'], karlan_df[karlan_df['ratio3'] == 0]['gave'])\n\nprint(\"T-Test Results for 2:1 match ratio:\")\nprint(f\"T-Statistic: {t_stat_ratio2}, P-Value: {p_value_ratio2}\")\n\nprint(\"\\nT-Test Results for 3:1 match ratio:\")\nprint(f\"T-Statistic: {t_stat_ratio3}, P-Value: {p_value_ratio3}\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nT-Test Results for 2:1 match ratio:\nT-Statistic: 1.6725548025261596, P-Value: 0.09442121711611902\n\nT-Test Results for 3:1 match ratio:\nT-Statistic: 1.7562202653799, P-Value: 0.07905691730335489\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOverall, based on these results, we do not have enough evidence to conclude that either the 2:1 match ratio or the 3:1 match ratio has a significantly different effect on charitable donations compared to the 1:1 match ratio.

They too found that \"that neither the match threshold nor the example amount had a meaningful influence on behavior.\"\n\n::: {#099be342 .cell execution_count=9}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport pyrsm as rsm\n\nreg_ratio = rsm.model.regress(\n    data = {\"Karlan DF\": karlan_df},\n    rvar = \"gave\",\n    evar = \"ratio\"\n)\n\nreg_ratio.summary()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nLinear regression (OLS)\nData                 : Karlan DF\nResponse variable    : gave\nExplanatory variables: ratio\nNull hyp.: the effect of x on gave is zero\nAlt. hyp.: the effect of x on gave is not zero\n\n           coefficient  std.error  t.value p.value     \nIntercept        0.018      0.001   16.225  < .001  ***\nratio[1]         0.003      0.002    1.661   0.097    .\nratio[2]         0.005      0.002    2.744   0.006   **\nratio[3]         0.005      0.002    2.802   0.005   **\n\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\nR-squared: 0.0, Adjusted R-squared: 0.0\nF-statistic: 3.665 df(3, 50079), p.value 0.012\nNr obs: 50,083\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn this regression, each ratio coefficient represents the effect of the corresponding ratio variable on charitable donations, holding other variables constant.

Ratio[2]: The coefficient is positive (0.005) and statistically significant (p = 0.006), indicating that for each unit increase in ratio[2], charitable donations increase by 0.005 units, holding other variables constant. Ratio[3]: Similar to Ratio[2], the coefficient is positive (0.005) and statistically significant (p = 0.005), suggesting that for each unit increase in ratio[3], charitable donations increase by 0.005 units, holding other variables constant. The intercept represents the expected value of the dependent variable (charitable donations) when all explanatory variables (ratio) are zero. In this case, the intercept is statistically significant (p < 0.001), indicating that when the ratio is zero, there is still a non-zero expected value of charitable donations.\n\nThe R-squared value (0.0) indicates that the model does not explain much of the variability in charitable donations. The F-statistic (3.665) tests the overall significance of the model. With a p-value of 0.012, the model is statistically significant, suggesting that at least one of the explanatory variables has a significant effect on charitable donations.\n\nOverall, the results suggest that ratio[2] and ratio[3] have a statistically significant positive effect on charitable donations, while ratio[1] does not have a statistically significant effect.

This demonstrates that as the sample size becomes larger, the estimate of the difference in means becomes more accurate and reliable. Therefore, as the sample size increases, the random sampling variability decreases, which indicates that the larger samples provide more precise estimates of population parameters and allows statisticians to make more explicit causal claims in experimentation.

According to the Central Limit Theorem, regardless of the shape of the population distribution, the distribution of sample averages tends to be normal (bell-shaped) as the sample size increases.\n\nIn a normal distribution, the mean (average) is located at the center of the distribution. As we increase the sample size, the distribution of sample averages becomes increasingly normal, and the mean of this distribution approaches the true population mean. Since we're plotting the distribution of sample averages, and zero represents the mean difference (which would be the population mean difference if the samples were large enough), it's expected that zero would be located in the center or \"middle\" of the distribution.\n\nTherefore, in the histograms representing the Central Limit Theorem, zero typically represents the \"middle\" of the distribution. As the sample size increases, the distribution becomes more concentrated around zero, indicating that the sample averages are more likely to be close to the true population mean difference.\n\n",
