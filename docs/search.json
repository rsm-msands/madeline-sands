randomization mechanism, I provide a series of tests that compare aspects of the treatment and control groups to assess whether they are statistically significantly different from one another.\nI have created a function called t_test_calc that calculates the t_stat and indicates if there is statistically signigicant difference between the variables in the treatment and test groups at a pre-determined confidence interval.\ntodo: test a few variables other than the key outcome variables (for example, test months since last donation) to see if the treatment and control groups are statistically significantly different at the 95% confidence level. Do each as a t-test and separately as a linear regression, and confirm you get the exact same results from both methods. When doing a t-test, use the formula in the class slides. When doing the linear regression, regress for example mrm2 on treatment and look at the estimated coefficient on the treatment variable. It might be helpful to compare parts of your analysis to Table 1 in the paper. Be sure to comment on your results (hint: why is Table 1 included in the paper).\n\ndef t_test_calc(data, treatment_col, control_col, outcome_col):\n    treatment = data[data[treatment_col] == 1]\n    control = data[data[control_col] == 1]\n    mean_treatment = treatment[outcome_col].mean()\n    mean_control = control[outcome_col].mean()\n    diff_means = mean_treatment - mean_control\n    std_treatment = treatment[outcome_col].std()\n    std_control = control[outcome_col].std()\n    n_treatment = len(treatment)\n    n_control = len(control)\n    t_stat = diff_means / np.sqrt((std_treatment**2/n_treatment) + (std_control**2/n_control))\n    return t_stat\n\n\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\nkarlan_df[\"mrm2\"].fillna(0, inplace = True)\n# Assuming data is a pandas DataFrame with columns 'outcome_variable', 'treatment', and 'other_variable'\nX = karlan_df[['treatment']]  # Features\ny = karlan_df['mrm2']  # Target variable\n\n# Create a linear regression model\nmodel = LinearRegression()\n\n# Fit the model to the data\nmodel.fit(X, y)\n\n# Print coefficients\nprint('Coefficients:', model.coef_)\nprint('Intercept:', model.intercept_)\n\nCoefficients: [0.01329623]\nIntercept: 12.99814226643495\n\n\n/var/folders/bj/t618x2614s9c896326lrdjw40000gn/T/ipykernel_71092/93217094.py:2: FutureWarning: A value is trying to be set on a copy of a DataFrame or Series through chained assignment using an inplace method.\nThe behavior will change in pandas 3.0. This inplace method will never work because the intermediate object on which we are setting values always behaves as a copy.\n\nFor example, when doing 'df[col].method(value, inplace=True)', try using 'df.method({col: value}, inplace=True)' or df[col] = df[col].method(value) instead, to perform the operation inplace on the original object.\n\n\n  karlan_df[\"mrm2\"].fillna(0, inplace = True)\n\n\nI believe that table 1 is included in the paper because of XXX. ## Experimental Results\n\n\nCharitable Contribution Made\nFirst, I analyzed whether matched donations lead to an increased response rate of making a donation.\n\nimport matplotlib as plt\nfrom matplotlib import rcParams\n\nkarlan_grouped = karlan_df.groupby([\"treatment\", \"control\"])[\"gave\"].sum()\n\nax = karlan_grouped.plot(kind='bar', color = [\"purple\", \"orange\"])\n\nrcParams['font.family'] = 'serif'  # Change 'serif' to the desired font family\nrcParams['font.serif'] = ['Avenir'] \n\n#plt.xlabel(\"Treatment vs. Control group\")\n#plt.ylabel('Number of people who Donated Money')\n#plt.title('Number of people who gave in treatment vs. control group')\n\ngroup_labels = ['Treatment', 'Control']\nax.set_xticklabels(group_labels, rotation = 0)\n\nfor i, v in enumerate(karlan_grouped):\n    ax.text(i, v + 0.1, str(v), ha='center', va='bottom')\n\n#plt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntodo: run a t-test between the treatment and control groups on the binary outcome of whether any charitable donation was made. Also run a bivariate linear regression that demonstrates the same finding. (It may help to confirm your calculations match Table 2a Panel A.) Report your statistical results and interpret them in the context of the experiment (e.g., if you found a difference with a small p-value or that was statistically significant at some threshold, what have you learned about human behavior? Use mostly English words, not numbers or stats, to explain your finding.)\ntodo: run a probit regression where the outcome variable is whether any charitable donation was made and the explanatory variable is assignment to treatment or control. Confirm that your results replicate Table 3 column 1 in the paper.\n\n\nDifferences between Match Rates\nNext, I assess the effectiveness of different sizes of matched donations on the response rate.\ntodo: Use a series of t-tests to test whether the size of the match ratio has an effect on whether people donate or not. For example, does the 2:1 match rate lead increase the likelihood that someone donates as compared to the 1:1 match rate? Do your results support the “figures suggest” comment the authors make on page 8?\ntodo: Assess the same issue using a regression. Specifically, create the variable ratio1 then regress gave on ratio1, ratio2, and ratio3 (or alternatively, regress gave on the categorical variable ratio). Interpret the coefficients and their statistical precision.\ntodo: Calculate the response rate difference between the 1:1 and 2:1 match ratios and the 2:1 and 3:1 ratios. Do this directly from the data, and do it by computing the differences in the fitted coefficients of the previous regression. what do you conclude regarding the effectiveness of different sizes of matched donations?\n\n\nSize of Charitable Contribution\nIn this subsection, I analyzed the effect of the size of matched donation on the size of the charitable contribution.\ntodo: Calculate a t-test or run a bivariate linear regression of the donation amount on the treatment status. What do we learn from doing this analysis?\ntodo: now limit the data to just people who made a donation and repeat the previous analysis. This regression allows you to analyze how much respondents donate conditional on donating some positive amount. Interpret the regression coefficients – what did we learn? Does the treatment coefficient have a causal interpretation?\ntodo: Make two plot: one for the treatment group and one for the control. Each plot should be a histogram of the donation amounts only among people who donated. Add a red vertical bar or some other annotation to indicate the sample average for each plot."

    "text": "Simulation Experiment\nAs a reminder of how the t-statistic “works,” in this section I use simulation to demonstrate the Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem.\nSuppose the true distribution of respondents who do not get a charitable donation match is Bernoulli with probability p=0.018 that a donation is made.\nFurther suppose that the true distribution of respondents who do get a charitable donation match of any size is Bernoulli with probability p=0.022 that a donation is made.\n\nLaw of Large Numbers\nto do: Make a plot like those on slide 43 from our first class and explain the plot to the reader. To do this, you will simulate 100,00 draws from the control distribution and 10,000 draws from the treatment distribution. You’ll then calculate a vector of 10,000 differences, and then you’ll plot the cumulative average of that vector of differences. Comment on whether the cumulative average approaches the true difference in means.\n\n\nCentral Limit Theorem\nto do: Make 4 histograms like those on slide 44 from our first class at sample sizes 50, 200, 500, and 1000 and explain these plots to the reader. To do this for a sample size of e.g. 50, take 50 draws from each of the control and treatment distributions, and calculate the average difference between those draws. Then repeat that process 999 more times so that you have 1000 averages. Plot the histogram of those averages. Comment on whether zero is in the “middle” of the distribution or whether it’s in the “tail.”"
